# Clean Angular Boilerplate

A boilerplate for large Angular projects.

## Inspiration/Motivation

Currently I'm working a lot with Angular and as I'm always looking to be a better ~~front-ender~~ professional, I look and ~~try to~~ use the best practices for the projects I work on. In my search, I've found two interesting articles at Medium, about clean code practices for Angular projects and a folder structure suggestion based on Angular Styleguides. 

Motivated by thisTo have this always at a hand, I'm creating this boilerplate to speed up the new projects creation.

Follows the Articles:

- [Clean Code Angular](https://itnext.io/clean-code-checklist-in-angular-%EF%B8%8F-10d4db877f74)
- [Angular Folder Structure](https://itnext.io/choosing-a-highly-scalable-folder-structure-in-angular-d987de65ec7)
